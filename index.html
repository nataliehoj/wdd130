        <p>Hello, I am Natalie Hojnacke, or Noodle (if that's what you want to call me lol). I am 19, and I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. I love to draw, play video games, make music, bake, hike, etc. I have two older sisters, and a younger brother. I am very close with all of them, and we all love to build with LEGO when we're all together. Some video games I really enjoy are Honkai: Star Rail, Final Fantasy XV, A Hat in Time, and R.E.P.O.</p>
        <p>Don't ever expect a serious picture of me because i can never take myself seriously lol</p>
