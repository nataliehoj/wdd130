        <p>Hello, I am Natalie Hojnacke, or Noodle (if that's what you want to call me lol). 
            I am 19, and I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. I love to draw, play video games, make music, bake, hike, etc. 
            I have two older sisters, and a younger brother. I am very close with all of them, and we all love to build with LEGO when we're all together. 
            I also have a dog named Buddy, he's a jack russel mix, and is about 10 years old. He spends a lot of time sleeping because he's a little old man lol and I love him.
            Some video games I really enjoy are Honkai: Star Rail, Final Fantasy XV, A Hat in Time, and R.E.P.O.</p>
        <p>Don't ever expect a serious picture of me because I can never take myself seriously lol</p>

        <h2>Las Vegas, Nevada</h2>
        <img src="images/las_vegas_strip.png" alt="Las Vegas Strip at night, arial view. The strip really isnt all that great... us locals avoid it as much as possible." width="300">
        <p>"Las Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. 
            At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated North American city founded within that century.
            The city bills itself as the Entertainment Capital of the World, and is famous for its luxurious and large casino-hotels. 
            As of 2023, Las Vegas attracts over 40.8 million visitors annually, 
            making it one of the most visited cities in the United States 
            and consistently ranking among the world's top tourist destinations." -from wikipedia</p>
            <p1>Us locals tend to avoid the strip though, because it's just tourist trap aside from the concert venues. -Natalie</p1>
